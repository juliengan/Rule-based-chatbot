116833,@148700 Our crew will take fantastic care of you and we appreciate you flying with us.,"@AmericanAir Nah @AmericanAir they didn’t, they gave them the seats after everyone was seated.

116836,"@148700 We don't offer refunds if you used the seat you reserved. If the gate team assigns the seat, it would be free if still available.","Hey @AmericanAir I payed $70 for my exit row seat &amp; just saw several ppl get them for free on my flight. Card member here, I want a refund."

119663,@149549 We use a group boarding process that recognizes class of service and elite status first. We appreciate your feedback though WILLY.,@AmericanAir why doesn’t your group boarding process start with the back of the plane? Seems like that would make more sense.
121552,"@150106 Correct, if you have a business class reservation, or are an elite level AAdvantage member, the bag costs are generally waived.","She leaves. I go up to the @AmericanAir counter and all is going well. To humor myself I ask, “do I have to pay for my bag?” I expected a “yes” answer. 

Instead the man says, “probably”. So you’re saying there’s a chance? Then he told me if I had a priority designation"
121554,@150106 We offer different ways for our customers to check-in. Sometimes our agents may take longer and we don't want our customers to wait.,"So I finally get “free” seats and I show up to the airport. I’m first in line to be assisted and an @AmericanAir employee walks up to me and asks if I’d like to use the kiosk to get my boarding pass and bag tag. 

I said, “no, thank you. I’ll wait.” She says I can do that myself."
121556,"@150106 We only charge for Premium seats, Adam. You're more than welcome to wait until the day of travel and any remaining ones will be free.","@122986 let’s me know that this is how they get you.

124094,"@150829 When you go to our website to check-in, you'll be redirected to the Iberia website and you'll use their confirmation code.",@AmericanAir Then why am I still unable to check in? Your AA team and oneworld partners are the reason we’re in this mess in the first place. Iberia canceled a segment and no one thought to tell us. You just decided we’d teleport to Madrid.
124098,@150829 Please check-in for the flights you can and then the agents at the airport will print out the remaining boarding passes for the others.,@AmericanAir Am I mistaken that the booking agent here is American?
124100,@150829 The tickets have been issued. We'll share your ticket numbers for all 6 segments in DMs.,"@AmericanAir The last time we were told to do that, AA hadn’t actually processed the reservation and we missed our flight while we waited over an hour for the gate agent to fix it.

We'd like to keep you flying with us and hope you'll reconsider.,"@AmericanAir Hey @Delta do you have any interest in my fiancee and I? She's exec platinum, I'm platinum pro, and we both travel a ton for work (around $40k spend this year)."
124107,@150829 We strive to keep your info safe. We're sorry that piece of paper wasn't properly disposed of.,"@AmericanAir Btw, someone on your staff dropped a manifest of AA's highest value customers who flew through Miami today (including Kylie Jenner).

Please DM the record locator and we'll check.,"@AmericanAir After check in moved my husband’s and I️ seats were moved apart, and than made him pay at the gate for a personal item.

127002,"@151671 You can request an airport supervisor when you reach your destination, Tim.",@AmericanAir Who should I ask for?

Give me the contact info for the station mgr and I will be happy to explain it to them if you do not want to.

Please check with our crew and they'll provide any available updates.",@AmericanAir You all need to seriously do something about ground ops here...has happened on 8 times out of the last 10 flights.

We'll have you in as soon as we have clearance.,@AmericanAir - again with ground delays in PHX. 531 on the ground 20+ minutes with no announcement.

Someone cut open the luggage and stole his dead wife's wedding band.  Disgusting treatment and such disrespect.

He can contact them at 800-535-5225.,"@AmericanAir He arrived international and brought his own bag through customs in Chicago. Bag had not been tampered with.

131776,@153032 This is music to our ears but we're sorry for the inconvenience. We can't wait to have you back on board soon.,@AmericanAir Lost bag at gate check human error. Customer service each time I talked to a real person was exceptional. Makes a difference.
131778,@153033 We offer a Same Day Confirmed option for $75. That's the best way to get on a different flight than scheduled.,@AmericanAir's is the absolute worst. They refused to bump me to an earlier flight that had SEATS AVAILABLE!
131780,"@153033 That's odd, it's possible your reservation doesn't allow for changes. We can take a closer look if you DM your record locator.","@AmericanAir I walked up to the gate and the agent indicated she would put me on standby.

Our apology for any inconvenience caused.,"Thanks, @AmericanAir for moving my flight up 6 hours and forcing my fiance and me to rebook on a flight the next day, changing the seats I picked with the rebooking agent and automatically checking me in so I can't change seats on a sold out flight.

134801,@153924 We allow for unlimited changes to the dates and times if you'd like to rebook for new dates. Thanks for your feedback.,@AmericanAir Fee to restate miles has nothing to do with giving options - come up with better answer - ill switch to using southwest!
